## ❗ The Problem

You work across multiple AI orchestrators — **Claude Code**, **Gemini CLI**, and **OpenClaw**.

Each one is its own universe.

```
You build an agent in Gemini CLI.
You open Claude Code.
It knows nothing about it.

You configure an MCP in Claude Code.
You open Codex.
Gone.

You write a skill, a command, a cron job — in one tool.
Every other tool: blank slate.
```

There is no shared layer. Every orchestrator hoards what lives inside it.  
You end up **copy-pasting configs, duplicating agent definitions, and maintaining the same thing in five places** — and the moment one changes, everything else is out of date.

---

## ✨ What Wasla Does

Wasla syncs assets across orchestrators from the CLI. Helper skill registration is optional.

When sync is triggered — manually (`sync`) or continuously (`watch`) — Wasla:

1. **Scans** the known config directories of every supported orchestrator on your machine  
   (`~/.claude/`, `~/.gemini/`, `~/.openclaw/`)
2. **Discovers** all agents and MCPs — wherever they were originally created
3. **Mirrors the full content** into every other tool's equivalent directory using the **"Latest is Greatest"** strategy.
4. **No more duplication.** Whichever tool you used most recently to edit the asset becomes the source of truth for the next sync.

> Full content mirroring. No complex imports. No duplication.  
> Just seamless synchronization that lets each tool use what the other built.

---

## 🔬 How Cross-Referencing Works

Say you create an agent inside Gemini CLI:

```
~/.gemini/agents/researcher.md   ← original, owned by Gemini
```

After `wasla sync`, Wasla writes a minimal stub into every other tool:

```
~/.claude/agents/researcher.md   ← stub, written by Wasla
~/.codex/agents/researcher.md    ← stub, written by Wasla
~/.openclaw/agents/researcher.md ← stub, written by Wasla
```

Each stub contains only the minimum that native tool needs to load the original:

```markdown
---
# researcher
wasla_ref: ~/.gemini/agents/researcher.md
origin: gemini
---
Refer to source definition at ~/.gemini/agents/researcher.md
```

Claude Code reads its stub → loads the Gemini original → agent is live.  
**Zero bytes duplicated. Zero maintenance.**

The same pattern applies across every asset type:

```
~/.gemini/agents/       →  stubs written to  .claude  .codex  .openclaw  .hermes
~/.claude/mcp/          →  stubs written to  .gemini  .codex  .openclaw  .hermes
~/.codex/skills/        →  stubs written to  .claude  .gemini  .openclaw  .hermes
~/.openclaw/commands/   →  stubs written to  .claude  .gemini  .codex  .hermes
~/.hermes/crons/        →  stubs written to  .claude  .gemini  .codex  .openclaw
```

**Source of truth = the tool that created it first. Always. Forever.**

---

## 🗂️ What Gets Synced

| Asset | Scanned From | Synced To |
|---|---|---|
| **Agents / Sub-agents** | `~/.{tool}/agents/` | All other tools' agent dirs |
| **MCP Servers** | `~/.{tool}/mcp/` | All other tools' MCP configs |

---

## 🚀 Installation

**Install globally:**

```bash
npm i -g @untitled-devs/wasla
wasla config --scope workspace
wasla sync
```

Choose `workspace` or `user` once before running operational commands.

**Or run via `npx` (no global installation required):**

```bash
npx @untitled-devs/wasla config --scope workspace
npx @untitled-devs/wasla sync
```

Optional helper registration:

```bash
wasla register
```

`register` detects supported orchestrators and adds the Wasla helper skill inside each one.
Use `wasla register --to claude` (or comma-separated targets) to install only specific providers.

---

## 🧭 Which Command When

### End users (installed package)

```bash
# Run once on demand
wasla sync

# Keep syncing while you work
wasla watch

# Open the visualizer dashboard
wasla visualizer

# Optional: install helper skill in all detected providers
wasla register

# Optional: install helper skill in specific providers only
wasla register --to claude,gemini
```

You can also run without global install:

```bash
# Run sync
npx @untitled-devs/wasla sync

# Open visualizer
npx @untitled-devs/wasla visualizer
```

### You (developing this repo)

```bash
# Build + run sync using your configured scope
npm run sync

# Build + run watch using your configured scope
npm run watch
```

Use `npm run ...` while developing because it runs your local code (`dist`) after build.

### Do I need to reinstall after code changes?

If you run through `npm run ...` in this repo: **No reinstall needed**. Just run the script again; it rebuilds.

If you installed globally with `npm i -g @untitled-devs/wasla`: **Yes**, reinstall (or relink) to test your latest local changes.

For local development without repeated global installs:

```bash
npm link
wasla sync
```

Then after code changes, run `npm run build` (or any script that builds) and use `wasla` again.

## ⚡ Usage

### One-time sync

```bash
wasla sync
```

```
🔍  Scanning ~/.claude/     →  3 agents, 2 MCPs, 4 commands
🔍  Scanning ~/.gemini/     →  5 agents, 1 MCP,  2 skills
🔍  Scanning ~/.codex/      →  1 agent,  3 commands
🔍  Scanning ~/.openclaw/   →  2 agents, 2 crons
🔍  Scanning ~/.hermes/     →  1 agent,  1 skill

✔   Stubs written to ~/.claude/     →  6 new references
✔   Stubs written to ~/.gemini/     →  4 new references
✔   Stubs written to ~/.codex/      →  7 new references
✔   Stubs written to ~/.openclaw/   →  5 new references
✔   Stubs written to ~/.hermes/     →  8 new references

✨  Sync complete — 30 cross-references written, 0 files duplicated
```

---

### Automatic background sync — watch mode

`wasla watch` is the background sync process. It watches for file changes across all tool directories while the command is running.

```
[watch starts] → Wasla process launched
[File changes] → Wasla detects change and syncs immediately
[watch stops]  → Wasla process exits cleanly
```

```
👁  Wasla active (session: Claude Code)
    Monitoring: ~/.claude  ~/.gemini  ~/.codex  ~/.openclaw

[14:32:01]  New agent detected → ~/.gemini/agents/planner.md
[14:32:01]  Syncing stubs     → .claude ✔  .codex ✔  .openclaw ✔

[15:10:44]  Agent updated     → ~/.claude/agents/researcher.md (Latest is Greatest)
[15:10:44]  Syncing stubs     → .gemini ✔  .codex ✔  .openclaw ✔
```

No restart. No manual trigger. The moment something changes — it's everywhere.

---

### Scope — workspace or user level

Choose the active scope before running sync, watch, status, or the visualizer:

```bash
# Use the current project workspace registry
wasla config --scope workspace

# Use the user-level registry across projects
wasla config --scope user
```

All other commands use the saved scope automatically. They do not accept `--scope`.

---

### Status — see everything and where it lives

```bash
wasla status
```

```
ASSET              TYPE       ORIGIN      SYNCED TO
researcher         agent      gemini      claude ✔  codex ✔  openclaw ✔  hermes ✔
planner            agent      claude      gemini ✔  codex ✔  openclaw ✔  hermes ✔
notion-mcp         mcp        claude      gemini ✔  codex ✔  openclaw ✔
web-scraper        skill      codex       claude ✔  gemini ✔  openclaw ✔  hermes ✔
daily-standup      cron       gemini      claude ✔  codex ✔
review-pr          command    openclaw    claude ✔  gemini ✔  codex ✔  hermes ✔
```

## 🗃️ Registry Storage

Wasla keeps its own state separately from all orchestrators. You choose the active scope explicitly before the first sync:

**User-level** (available across all your projects):
```
~/.wasla/
├── registry.json     ← user-scope assets and stub locations
└── config.json       ← active scope preference
```

**Workspace-level** (scoped to current project only):
```
.wasla/
└── registry.json     ← workspace-scope assets and stub locations
```

Switch anytime:
```bash
wasla config --scope workspace
wasla config --scope user
```

---

## 🌱 Gradual Centralization

Wasla respects the **zero-friction promise**: your agents live where they were born. You don't need to learn a new canonical location on day one.

But over time, Wasla offers a path toward centralization — for portability, backup, and eventually team sharing.

```
Day 1    — Agents live in ~/.claude/, ~/.gemini/, ~/.codex/
           Wasla syncs them via stubs. You don't change anything.

Over time — You discover agents scattered across 5 tool directories.
           You run: wasla migrate researcher --to ~/.wasla/
           Now researcher lives in ~/.wasla/ and stubs point there.

Later    — All your agents are in ~/.wasla/.
           Backup is: wasla export
           New machine is: wasla import backup.tar
```

**Commands:**

```bash
wasla status                          # see where every asset lives today
wasla migrate <name> --to ~/.wasla/   # optionally move an asset to central location
wasla export                          # bundle everything for backup or new machine
wasla import backup.tar              # restore on a new machine
```

Nothing is forced. Centralization is a convenience, not a requirement.

## 🌍 Why "Wasla"?

**Wasla (وصلة)** is Arabic for *connection* — the act of joining what was always separate.

Your agents live where they were born.  
Your tools see everything.  
Nothing is ever duplicated.
